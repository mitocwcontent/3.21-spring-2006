This page lists the homework problems suggested to accompany each lecture session. These problems are not graded, but students are strongly encouraged to work through them.

The problems and solutions are in the course textbook:

Balluffi, R. W., S. M. Allen, and W. C. Carter. _Kinetics of Materials_. New York, NY: John Wiley & Sons, 2005. ISBN: 9780471246893.
