Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 3 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Recitations: 1 session / week, 1 hour / session

Prerequisites
-------------

[3.012](/courses/3-012-fundamentals-of-materials-science-fall-2005), 3.022, [3.044](/courses/3-044-materials-processing-spring-2013), or permission of instructor.

Textbook
--------

Balluffi, R. W., S. M. Allen, and W. C. Carter. _Kinetics of Materials_. New York, NY: John Wiley & Sons, 2005. ISBN: 9780471246893.

Homework
--------

For most class sessions, homework problems will be suggested from the course textbook. These problems will not be graded, but students are strongly encouraged to work through them and consult the solutions in the book as needed.
